TODO:
1. include uncertainty for fingertip position

    Problem setup: during inference, still predict the joint angle configurations given EE position and sampling. However, there are more solutions for similar joint angle configuration introduced by the surface contact point.

2. Implement MMD

3. include self collision

4. Evaluation Aspects

5. implement
